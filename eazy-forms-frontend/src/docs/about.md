## **About**  
&nbsp;  
Ezforms is an opensource web server for your forms which started as a hobby project. It manages all form responses from your webpage. No need to maintain a complete database and a server to collect responses. It is non-profit project to help other developers.

## **Motivation**  
&nbsp;  
Formsubmit.io is the ultimate motivation behind Ezforms. I was amazed by the simplicity and the problem it solves for developers. And that is why I also wanted to create a similar website and test my skills.

## **What it is**  
&nbsp;  
Ezforms provides you a simple url which you put in your **"action"** attribute of form and all the form response are visible in Ezforms dashboard. It also allows you to detect spam responses by using a simple **honeypot** technique. Also you can integrate **Telegram** and **Slack** to get response directly on them as messages.
